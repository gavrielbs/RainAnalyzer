# Final Project - Rain Analyzer

One of the questions raised in the lab lately is how patterns of rain affect ecosystem productivity.
Rain plays a key role and its effects on plants ecosystems can be seen in the following year and even in the year after.  
In order to understand how the rain affects the productivity of plants, it's yearly seasonality characteristics are needed to be extracted.
In this project I will analyze time series of rain, downloaded from the Israel Meteorological Service's API.
The characteristics I will extract are: 
- yearly cumulative rain
- rate of accumulation
- season duration
- yearly cumulative rain of the previous year two years before
- average rain per rainy day
- consecutive dry days between rain seasons

 The output will include a .csv file with the extracted data, and plots of the rain along with its different characteristics.
